    "    * Breath-First-Search\n",
    "        * It starts from the root node, explores the neighboring nodes first and moves towards the next level neighbors. It generates one tree at a time until the solution is found. It can be implemented using FIFO queue data structure. This method provides shortest path to the solution.\n",
    "    * Depth-First-Search\n",
    "        * It is implemented in recursion with LIFO stack data structure. It creates the same set of nodes as Breadth-First method, only in the different order.\n",
    "    * Uniform Cost-Search\n",
    "        * Sorting is done in increasing cost of the path to a node. It always expands the least cost node. It is identical to Breadth First search if each transition has the same cost.\n",
    "    * A* Search\n",
    "        * It is best-known form of Best First search. It avoids expanding paths that are already expensive, but expands most promising paths first.     "
